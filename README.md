# Infos

☕ ***Chill*** is a small one week project whose goal was to create an ***instant chill*** music player, greatly inspired by Traf's [Sunday.fm](https://sunday.fm/).

I first made this website for me, so all the available albums are chosen among my favorites ones 🎵. And *Yes*, I have chosen to stream albums and not 24/7 web radio feed in order to keep a certain consistency among tracks. 

Hope you like it 💖

*(The player is directly streaming from Youtube via a hidden youtube embed player. Nothing is stored on the web server)*
